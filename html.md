Prepare file index.html

```bash
$ touch index.html
```

Add to this file:
```html
<p>Hello, world!</p>
```

Open it:
```bash
$ open index.html
```

The prototypical HTML skeleton begins with an html tag containing two elements, a head and a body. These latter tags are nested inside the html tag, as follows:

```html
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```
